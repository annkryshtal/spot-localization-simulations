# spot-localization-simulations
Simulated data and analysis code exploring mechanisms of spatial response localization in the retina.  Includes custom models, response fitting routines, and modeling of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) receptive fields, originally developed during my time in the Schwartz Lab at Northwestern University.
